  abstract = {In this study we have dealt with the uniqueness of the solutions of a class of initial-boundary value problems in linear, isotropic, homogeneous, nonlocal elasticity. The proof of uniqueness is based on the positive definiteness of total strain energy. After giving the sufficient conditions under which total strain energy is positive definite, it has been shown that the solutions of the initial-boundary value problems which are considered in this study are unique. Existence of the solutions of these problems is an a priori assumption.}

While classical hydrology has often focused on steady flow conditions, many systems display periodic behavior due to tidal, seasonal, annual, and human influences. Describing and quantifying subsurface hydraulic responses to these influences may be challenging to those who are unfamiliar with periodically forced groundwater systems. The goal of this volume is to present a clear and accessible mathematical introduction to the basic and advanced theory of time-periodic groundwater flow, which is essential for developing a comprehensive knowledge of groundwater hydraulics and groundwater hydrology.},

  abstract = {In this paper the physically-based approach to non-local elasticity theory is introduced. It is formulated by reverting the continuum to an ensemble of interacting volume elements. Interactions between adjacent elements are classical contact forces while long-range interactions between non-adjacent elements are modelled as distance-decaying central body forces. The latter are proportional to the relative displacements rather than to the strain field as in the Eringen model and subsequent developments. At the limit the displacement field is found to be governed by an integro-differential equation, solved by a simple discretization procedure suggested by the underlying mechanical model itself, with corresponding static boundary conditions enforced in a quite simple form. It is then shown that the constitutive law of the proposed model coalesces with the Eringen constitutive law for an unbounded domain under suitable assumptions, whereas it remains substantially different for a bounded domain. Thermodynamic consistency of the model also has been investigated in detail and some numerical applications are presented for different parameters and different functional forms for the decay of the long range forces. For simplicity, the problem is formulated for a 1D continuum while the general formulation for a 3D elastic solid has been reported in the appendix. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract        = {The strain energy of a deformed material with spatial interaction can be written either in a differential (multipolar) form, i.e. as a single volume integral containing displacement gradients up to infinite order, or in an integral (non-local) form, e.g. as a double volume integral summing up the interactions of pairs of mass elements. The linear theory is derived from lattice theory and the following insights have been gained: 1. (1) The differential theory, though in principle applicable to any (analytic) elastic long range problem, is mainly convenient in describing range effects on a very small (nearly atomic) scale. 2. (2) The effects of the electric cohesive forces can be comprised in the two-point material tensors (kernels) of the non-local theory. In this way, the macroscopical theory becomes purely elastic. 3. (3) Van der Waals cohesive forces give rise to elastic range effects under certain inhomogeneous stress conditions, in particular in defect interaction and diffusion problems. {\textcopyright} 1967.},

  abstract = {A simple mechanical one-dimensional problem in the context of nonlocal (integral) elasticity is solved analytically. The nonlocal elastic material behaviour is described by the “Eringen model” whose nonlocality features all reside in the constitutive relation. This relation, of integral type, contains an attenuation function (usually assumed symmetric) aimed to capture the diffusion process of the nonlocality effects; it also exhibits a convolution format. The governing equation is a Fredholm integral equation of second kind whose analytical treatment, even for the usual choice of a symmetric kernel, is not easy to develop. In the present paper, assuming a specific shape for the attenuation function, a closed form solution in terms of strains is alternatively obtained by solving a Volterra integral equation of second kind. The latter can be easily solved with standard techniques, at least for the adopted kernel, taking also advantage from the symmetry of the solution. Such a closed form solution is an essential result to validate the effectiveness of numerical procedures aimed to solve more complex mechanical problems in the context of nonlocal elasticity.}

@article{Pisano2009,
  abstract  = {A finite element based method, theorized in the context of nonlocal integral elasticity and founded on a nonlocal total potential energy principle, is numerically implemented for solving 2D nonlocal elastic problems. The key idea of the method, known as nonlocal finite element method (NL-FEM), relies on the assumption that the postulated nonlocal elastic behaviour of the material is captured by a finite element endowed with a set of (cross-stiffness) element's matrices able to interpret the (nonlocality) effects induced in the element itself by the other elements in the mesh. An Eringen-type nonlocal elastic model is assumed with a constitutive stress-strain law of convolutive-type which governs the nonlocal material behaviour. Computational issues, as the construction of the nonlocal element and global stiffness matrices, are treated in detail. Few examples are presented and the relevant numerical findings discussed both to verify the reliability of the method and to prove its effectiveness. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The Eringen model of nonlocal elasticity is considered and its implications in solid mechanics studied. The model is refined by assuming an attenuation function depending on the 'geodetical distance' between material particles, such that in the diffusion processes of the nonlocality effects certain obstacles as holes or cracks existing in the domain can be circumvented. A suitable thermodynamic framework with nonlocality is also envisaged as a firm basis of the model. The nonlocal elasticity boundary-value problem for infinitesimal displacements and quasi-static loads is addressed and the conditions for the solution uniqueness are established. Three variational principles, nonlocal counterparts of classical ones, i.e. the total potential energy, the complementary energy, and the mixed Hu-Washizu principles, are provided. The former is used to derive a nonlocal-type FEM (NL-FEM) in which the (symmetric) global stiffness matrix reflects the nonlocality features of the problem. An alternative standard-FEM-based solution method is also provided, which consists in an iterative procedure of the type local prediction/nonlocal correction, in which the nonlocality is simulated by an imposed-like correction strain. The potentialities of these analysis methods are pointed out, their numerical implementations being the object of an ongoing research work. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {A two-component local/nonlocal constitutive model for (macroscopically) inhomogeneous linear elastic materials (but constant internal length) is proposed, in which the stress is the sum of the local stress and a nonlocal-type stress expressed in terms of the strain difference field, hence identically vanishing in the case of uniform strain. Attention is focused upon the particular case of piecewise homogeneous material. The proposed model is thermodynamically consistent with a suitable free energy potential. It constitutes an improved form of the Vermeer and Brinkgreve [A new effective nonlocal strain measure for softening plasticity. In: Chambon, R., Desrues, J., Vardulakis, I.

Balkema, Rotterdam, 1994, pp. 89-100] model, and can also be considered derivable from the Eringen nonlocal elasticity model through a suitable enhancement technique based on the concept of redistribution of the local stress. The concept of equivalent distance is introduced to macroscopically account for the further attenuation effects produced by the inhomogeneity upon the long distance interaction forces. With the aid of a piecewise homogeneous bar in tension, a portion of which degrades progressively till failure, it is shown that-under a suitable choice of a material constant-the solution procedure exhibits no pathological features (numerical instability, mesh sensitivity) in every degraded bar condition, including the limit idealized stress-free condition of the failed bar. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
